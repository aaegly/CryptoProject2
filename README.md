# CryptoProject2
Make a digital wallet

Idea:

Hardware wallet, able to store at least one type of cryptocurrency, as we discussed in class. I can't remember if the professor told us to take a BIP from another wallet, but I'll ask in class. I'll also be looking at Atomic wallet, Bread wallet, Mycelium, Exodus, etc. as references for how my wallet should be implemented.

Objectives:

Look into and learn how to implement a hardware wallet on either my Pi or onto a usb. This wallet would have to be able to store crytpocurrency while staying cryptographically secure.

Deliverables:

At the end of the project I would deliver a functional hardware wallet that could be used to store bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

Resources:

Hardware- Raspberry pi, possibly a usb (I've been reading about saving hardware wallets on usbs, but they're small and easy to lose)

Software- Python or C (I'm still looking into what I need to use specifically, but I am looking into BIP32 for python by pywallet)
