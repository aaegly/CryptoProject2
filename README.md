# CryptoProject2
Make a digital wallet

Running code- 
To run my RSA algorithm, running on python 3 works and putting something to be encrypted will show it being encrypted then decrypted.

example- 
./rsa 2a7Bs4MNu79b3Qwe : this will encrypt/decrypt

Idea:

Hardware wallet, able to store at least one type of cryptocurrency, as we discussed in class. I can't remember if the professor told us to take a BIP from another wallet, but I'll ask in class. I'll also be looking at Atomic wallet, Bread wallet, Mycelium, Exodus, etc. as references for how my wallet should be implemented.

Objectives:

Look into and learn how to implement a hardware wallet on either my Pi or onto a usb. This wallet would have to be able to store crytpocurrency while staying cryptographically secure. Implement an RSA algorithm.

Deliverables:

At the end of the project I would deliver a functioning RSA algorithm for a crypto wallet.

Resources:

Hardware- Raspberry pi, possibly a usb (I've been reading about saving hardware wallets on usbs, but they're small and easy to lose)

Software- Python(PyCharm)
